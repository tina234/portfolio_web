		<p class="desc">Hello, my name is Martina and I'm a passionate frontend developer from Rijeka.
			I have been creating websites in Vue.js framework for more than year and a half. Of course, in the beginning it was single page websites
			but with more and more experience I manage to create more complex projects.
			I also gained professional experience at my first job, where I encountered other technologies like React.js, GraphQL, TypeScript..
			My goal is to improve my current skills day by day and I'm looking forward to learning from more experienced developers.
